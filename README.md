- *C is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and Bell Labs, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targetted CPUs.*

- *A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers available for the almost all modern computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).*

- *C is an imperative procedural language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.*

- *Since 2000, C has consistently ranked among the top two languages in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages.*

- **HackerRank, a coding-based technical skills and assessment platform, is one of the many tools used by Goldman Sachs to assess candidates for roles within Engineering.**
- **HackerRank is very good for beginners so even if you want to print your first program ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù then definitely HackerRank gives this opportunity to you.**
- **It has a pretty good UI with boilerplate code pre-written that helps beginners to start competitive coding.**
